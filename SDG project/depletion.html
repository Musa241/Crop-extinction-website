        <h2>Groundwater Depletion and Water Quality Issues</h2>
        <p>Groundwater is over-extracted in some parts of the city, and depletion is already felt, particularly in peri-urban areas that do not have piped water infrastructures. In Hyderabad, there are also problems with water quality. Fluoride, nitrates, and heavy metals have been found in a few regions and even in groundwater. Because of the poor practices in the treatment of water in some localities, water-borne diseases are present.</p>

        <h2>Sanitation Challenges in Hyderabad</h2>
        <p>Despite achieving significant improvement in sanitation conditions in Hyderabad, quality sanitation access is still uneven and lacking everywhere in most informal settlements and peri-urban zones. Most households and communities still rely on pit latrines or open defecation due to lack of access to proper sewerage systems.</p>
