      <h1>Community-Based Solutions for Clean Water and Sanitation</h1>
      <p>
        What can we as a group do to provide access to clean water and sanitation? One way to address the problem is to raise awareness through a website. This website can describe why clean water is important, what problems exist with water scarcity, and what pollution actually is. Its graphics and videos are understandable. Sections relating to the problems of water should be portrayed to bring it to the notice of your community or region.

      <h1>Partnering for Change</h1>
      <p>
        Partner for higher awareness campaigns and events. Hold sessions that educate the people on preventing wastewater, safe storage of water, and preventing pollution. Bring out students for activities like experiments on testing water, polluting cleanup days, and awareness talks. Partner them in awareness programs or cleanup efforts that are more direct. Encourage the installation of water-saving appliances, leak-fixing, and short showers or conscious use. Encourage rainwater harvesting in homes, schools, and public buildings so that the proportion of fresh sources is reduced. Enforce greywater reuse in irrigation; this will cut down on freshwater usage.
