            <h1>Addressing the Problem: A Multi-faceted Approach</h1>
            <p>
                To address the problem of clean water and sanitation, action and coordination among governments, organizations, 
                and people are required. Governments must begin by increasing political commitment for safely managed drinking water, 
                sanitation, and hygiene. Effective service delivery would require proper governance structures, enforcement of 
                health-based standards, and an application of health-based standards, with transparency in monitoring and reporting progress.
