      <h1>Sewage Treatment and Solid Waste Management</h1>
      <p>Hyderabad has expanded so fast that its sewage treatment infrastructure cannot keep up with it. Only a few percent of the sewage passing through the city is treated before it is let off into the water bodies. This gives rise to river and lake pollution like Hussain Sagar. These untreated wastewaters are a health and environmental hazard. The city generates much waste daily; although the primary and main objective of collecting and processing waste is cleanliness and hygiene, most of the uncollected waste ends up in water bodies and thus increases water pollution, causing all drainage systems to clog.</p>
